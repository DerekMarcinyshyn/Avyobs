# Avalanche Observations

A real time weather and avalanche observation tool built on node.js using [Meteor][1].

A work in progress...

## Features

* Twitter Bootstrap for responsive design
* Google Maps for visuals
* Allow users to submit their observations
* Display weather around British Columbia

## Background

Since I live in Revelstoke, the app will begin with this general area to start for beta testing.
